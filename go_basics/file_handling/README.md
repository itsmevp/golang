- Working with low level api's
  - In go the file mode value is represented by `os.FileMode` type, which is derived from `uint32`
  - `os` file package provides a `File.Chmod()` function to change the permission of a file, which takes numeric file mode value of type `os.FileMode`
  - **File Open-time Flags**
    - When we open a file using some open() function call, we can pass an extra argument which is called an open-time flag that determines how a file should be opened and what operations can be performed on it.
