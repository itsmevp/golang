- **Working with low level api's**
  - In go the file mode value is represented by `os.FileMode` type, which is derived from `uint32`
  - `os` file package provides a `File.Chmod()` function to change the permission of a file, which takes numeric file mode value of type `os.FileMode`
  - **File Open-time Flags**
    - When we open a file using some open() function call, we can pass an extra argument which is called an open-time flag that determines how a file should be opened and what operations can be performed on it.

    - `func OpenFile(name string, flag int, perm FileMode) (*File, error)` 
    - The `os.OpenFile` function opens an existing file on the system or creates one with the perm file mode if not already exists. The flag argument is the open-time flags.
  - **File Descriptor**
    - A file descriptor or fd is a unique non-negative integer value that points to an opened file on the system.
    - In a Unix-like operating system, the first three file descriptors represent Standard Streams.
    - Hence, fd is `0` for `STDIN`, `1` for `STDOUT` and `2` for `STDERR`.
    - Whenever we create a new file or open an existing, our operating system adds the entry in the table of the open file and returns the file descriptor to work with.
  - **Working with a file**
    - The `os.File` structure type represents an open file in Go.
    - This structure doesn’t have any public field but it provides few methods to read and write the file’s content.
    - The `os.Open` opens an existing file from the disk with os.O_RDONLY open-time flag. If the file does not exist, it returns an error of type *os.PathError.
    - The `os.OpenFile` is a generalized function to open a file that provides control over open-time flags and the file-mode.
    - `func Remove(path string) error` This function deletes a file from the disk at a given path provided by the path argument. This function returns an *os.PathError error if the file is missing or if the path is a non-empty directory.
    - However, you can use `os.RemoveAll` function to remove a directory (or a file) and all its children (directory content). If the path does not exist, it does nothing and returns a nil error.
    
- **io/ioutil package**
  - Important functions from **io/ioutil package** package.
    - `func ReadDir(dirname string) ([]os.FileInfo, error)` function returns the information about files contained in a directory.
    - If you need to list the files in a directory filtered by a glob pattern, then you should use `func Glob(pattern string) (matches []string, err error)`.
    - `func ReadFile(filepath string) ([]byte, error)` function returns the content of the file as an array of bytes.
    - `func WriteFile(filepath string, data []byte, perm os.FileMode) error` If a file with the filepath does not exist, it will be created. If the file already exists, the file’s content will be wiped out (truncated) before writing new content.
