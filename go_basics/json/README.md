- Working with JSON in golang
  - A JSON can represent a dictionary or a list and items can be any supported data types.
  - In Go, the closest we can get to JSON representation is through map or struct data types.
  - JSON supports primarily 6 data types viz. `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `array` and `object`.
  - **Encoding JSON:**
    - `func Marshal(v interface{}) ([]byte, error)`
    - Converting an object to a JSON string, v can be a map or a struct.
    - If you want to format the JSON with newlines and indentation, you can use `json.MarshalIndent` function which internally calls the Marshal function. This function takes the prefix and indentation as the argument.
    - The Marshal function only considers the exported fields for the encoding.
    - We can also encode map data type into JSON data.
    - The necessary condition is that map keys should be either string or int.
    - If a value is a pointer, then the value of the pointer is used for the marshaling.
    - If a value is an interface, then the concrete value of the interface is used for the marshaling.
    - If a promoted field name conflicts with the field name from the parent structure, then the least nested field is selected for the marshaling.
    - A structure can have an anonymously nested structure. In such a case, the fields of that structure (as well as methods) are promoted to the parent structure.
  - **Data Type Conversion:**
    - Sometimes, we do not want to encode a field value as it is but to provide a custom value for marshaling. 
    - This can be achieved by implementing `json.Marshaler` or `encoding.TextMarshaler` interface.
    - If a field’s value implements one of the above interfaces, then Marshal function won’t consider the field’s value for marshaling and instead use the value returned by the method MarshalJSON or MarshalText method.
    - https://play.golang.org/p/xxg31Vd2i1d is a nice example to understand Marshaler interfaces.
