- Creating go routines
  - Use `go` keyword in front of function call
  - When using anonymous functions, pass data as local variables
- Synchronization
  - WaitGroups
    - Use `sync.WaitGroup` to wait for groups of goroutines to complete
    - Add(), Wait(), Done()
  - Mutexes
    - Use `sync.Mutex` and `sync.RWMutex` to protect data access
- Parallelism
  - By default, Go will use CPU threads equal to available cores
  - Change with runtime.GOMAXPROCS
  - More threads can increase performance, but too many can slow it down
- Best Practices
  - Don't create goroutines in libraries
      - Let consumer control concurrency
  - When creating a goroutine, know how it will end
      - Avoid subtle memory leaks
  - Check for race condition at compile time
      - `go run -race main.go`
